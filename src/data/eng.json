  "introduction": "A curious mix of Brazilian, Argentinian, and Spanish, and I’ve lived in 9 countries (and counting!). Fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, and English, and learning French, I thrive on building strong interpersonal relationships and crafting creative solutions. About to finish a Dual Master’s between Sciences Po in Paris and LSE in London, I’m results-oriented and always focused on what matters most. When I’m not working, you’ll find me hiking, cooking, or working with ceramics. Want to know more? Scroll down and grab my CV!"
